# AG: Automatic API Generator to Access & Visualize Open Data

This is an automatic API generator from CSV open data resources.

In order to solve the problem of accessing data, it is proposed a methodology that consists in the automatic generation of APIs, which allows a direct and simple access to data. This generation process is based on metamodels to facilitate the comprehension, reuse and standardization of the API. Thus, from an open data source, an API and its definition and documentation will be generated automatically. Moreover, it will be generated a visualization of the data for data analysis purposes.
