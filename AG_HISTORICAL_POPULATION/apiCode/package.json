The API response will be in JSON format, containing a list of objects with properties: LOCATION, Country, SEX, Sex, AGE, Age, TIME, Time, Value, FlagCodes, Flags. In addition, the following parameters can always be used: visualization, which is used to show the information graphically; limit, which serves to limit the maximum number of results to show (default 10000); and offset, to indicate from which number to return from the results set, very useful for pagination results. An example of a query would be the following: localhost:8080/v1/LOCATION/AUS",
